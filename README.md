# Welcome to my front-end developer portfolio!
I'm a passionate front-end developer with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now I'm in the process of learning React and Node.js

In this portfolio, I showcase my work on a variety of projects, including:

<!--
- A personal website that I built using React
- A web application that I built using Angular
- A mobile app that I built using Vue.js
-->
  
I'm also a strong believer in user experience (UX) design. I take the time to understand the needs of my users and create interfaces that are both beautiful and functional.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you're interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me.
